<h3>Homework 1: Web Project Proposal</h3>
<p>
    My database experience is currently very limited. I have worked with 
    SQlite and MySQL in the past but only on small projects.
    I understand enough to write basic create and select statements.
    
</p>
<p>    
    I proposed to create a web application that allows users to log in and interact with
    create a rental transaction and leave a comment. 
    Click <a href="Data/OMara_instrument_rental_model.pdf">here</a> to see a document that includes my proposed data model.
</p>
<p>
    This thing that I found to be most challenging about this assignment
    was implementing a proper fluid design. I keep running into issues where 
    my nav bar or text wont wrap properly and preventing scroll bars from 
    popping in and out of the browser window
</p>


<h3>Homework 2: Database</h3>
<p>
    In this homework, I learned how to create tables in a relational database,  
    populate these tables, and select data from these tables. 
    Click <a href="Data/OMara_HW2.pdf">here</a> to see the document I submitted for this homework. 
    
    That hardest part about configuring my database was that I had to go back 
    and modify a few things after the initial table creation. Some of the data
    types had not been properly set during the schema creation. I ended up learning
    a lot about using the MODIFY TABLE command and how to update and change column 
    names and entries. Once my tables had been properly initialized the select statements
    where not so difficult to write. 
</p>

<h3>Homework 3: Home Page</h3>
<p>
    My web development/design experience consists of absolutely no background at all.
    Feeling a little overwhelmed by the amount of things I've needed to take in.
    I have very little experience with js, html, and css so stuck I'm 
    learning 3 different things at once. I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing
    most of the time. The biggest problem I have is that I can't simply 
    ask a few questions to get what I need to know. I don't know what I need
    until I'm in the middle of a problem that I can't immediately solve.
    Thankfully there's google stack and w3schools.
</p>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to create a home page that uses JavaScript to make 
    AJAX calls to read HTML partial files that get injected into the content area  
    (to achieve HTML code reuse). 
    I had a lot of trouble getting my nav bar to function properly. I'm not well versed in 
    css but I eventually figured out that I need to change the padding and min-width
    properties to get the spacing right at smaller resolutions. 
    This weeks assignment covered a lot of topics new topics. I feel like most of my time
    is spent reading and re reading descriptions rather than writing code or fixing
    and existing problem. In spite of this I now understand CSS and java script 
    a little better than before.
</p>

<h3>Homework 4: Display Data</h3>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to write Web APIs using JSP pages (server side technology) to 
    output database data in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation). I also learned how to write JavaScript 
    code to (1) convert the JSON to a JavaScript object and (2) build an HTML table to hold the 
    data from the JavaScript object.  
</p>
<p>
    [[Describe how you combined database fields into HTML table data cells to create an appealing 
    data display, especially for your associative table which joined data from web_user and "other".
    Describe important concepts that you learned and anything that you found challenging.]]
